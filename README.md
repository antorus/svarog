Simple program to measure hourly productivity using specifically formatted CSV files utilizing JAVAFX for a simple GUI.
Created for learning purposes.

## How to install
Folder "Runnable" can be downloaded and executed directly using the provided .exe file.

## How it works
The program requires some basic inputs: employee names, specific queues worked (our specificic queues from Zendesk were 
used in the context of the tool), HubStaff (time management tool) tasks.
Once the data is entered into the code, the program will require the CSV files generated by those external tools 
in order to make the calculation.
The CSV file required by ProductivityCSVReader has a specific format used internally at my place of work and 
will probably not be applicable in other situations.
